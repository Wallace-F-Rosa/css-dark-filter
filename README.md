# css-dark-filter
CSS filter to be used in chrome as a customable dark mode.\
This was inspired by the article [Dark Mode With One Line Of Code](https://dev.to/ekaterina_vu/dark-mode-with-one-line-of-code-4lkm).\
THIS FILTER USES INVERT! You have been warned!\
You can apply this using an extension like [Dark mode](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-mode/dmghijelimhndkbmpgbldicpogfkceaj) that lets you override the css on web pages.
